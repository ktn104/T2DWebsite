# Abstract 
Our project’s goal is to discover and find what areas of the genes are related to Type II Diabetes. To accomplish this goal, we use summary statistics data from genome-wide association studies, which search the genome for small variations, called single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs), that occur more frequently in people with a particular disease than in people without the disease.  These summary statistics contain information such as the variant id, the chromosome, the position, the allele, the effect allele, and the p values. From the data, we are able to determine which areas of the genes are associated with Type II Diabetes and potentially find more within meta-analysis between studies. From the summary statistics of several studies we are able to analyze and determine which area of genes contribute to Type II Diabetes.  For the whole project, we hypothesize that for patients who have Type II Diabetes, their p values associated with Type II Diabetes should be significantly higher. We recognize that though we would be able to find the areas of genes that are related to Type II Diabetes. We can never be so sure that those areas are the only ones causing the disease. Besides genetic factors, environmental and physiological factors, such as being overweight and inactive and being in a bad mood, seem to be contributing factors.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ktn104/T2DWebsite/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
